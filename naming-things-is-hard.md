# name origin

-   searched words ending in **lac** (starting with some prefix, **la** for language, **c** for
    compiler), because i wanted the compiler to be a regular word itself

-   found **lilac**, fits very well with the language name being **lila**

-   lila (Sanskrit) loosely translated means **play** - happy coincidence :)

-   searching for good (recursive) acronyms with aspell:

        aspell -d en dump master | aspell -l en expand | grep -i ^i | sort -f | less
        aspell -d en dump master | aspell -l en expand | grep -i ^l | sort -f | less
